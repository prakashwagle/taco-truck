# Taco Truck GitHub Pages

This repository contains a simple static website for a vegan Mexicali taco truck located at the Redwood City Caltrain Station. The site can be published with GitHub Pages.

## Development

The site consists of basic HTML and CSS files. Placeholder images are embedded directly in the HTML as base64 data URIs. Edit the HTML files directly if you need to update the content.

To preview locally, you can serve the directory with Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Deployment

Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and select the `main` branch as the source. The site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>`.
